  <p>Hello! I'm Alex, an English/Finnish hybrid organism and Full Stack Developer currently living in Helsinki, Finland.
    I
    graduated with a Bachelor's degree in
    Business Information Technology from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in 2019.
  </p>

  <p>The topic of my Bachelor's thesis was a comparitive analysis of JavaScript package managers that were available in
    2019,
    which you can read <a href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/227945" target="_blank">here</a></p>

  <p>In my free time I am a voracious watcher of films, a frequent player of
    tabletop role playing games and an
    occasional player of video games.</p>

  <p>My friends have described my taste in films thusly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Why did you make me watch that shit?"</li>
    <li>"That was the worst film I've ever seen"</li>
    <li>"Why don't we watch anything good?"</li>
    <li>"Why do you own so many Jean Claude Van Damme films?</li>
    <li>"Watching that was actively painful. Let's watch some more"</li>
  </ul>

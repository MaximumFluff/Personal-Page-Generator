  <p>Supposedly well informed people have informed me that Rust is the future of low level programming. Although, to be fair; compared to JavaScript pretty much everything else is low level programming at this point, so what would I know about it? (the joke being that JavaScript uses a lot of memory)</p>
<p>Memory safety with the borrow checker! An actual package manager! developer experience! the dream is real! By sheer, utter coincidence the next couple of terminal applications I list here are mostly written in Rust.</p>
<h2>bat</h2>
<hr />
<p><code>bat</code> is nice drop-in replacement for <code>cat</code> that features neat features like syntax highlighting for multiple programming and markup languages, line numbers and displaying multiple files output at once. <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">Installation and usage instructions for bat can be found here</a></p>
<h2>eza</h2>
<hr />
<p><code>eza</code> is a fork of exa (which I found out during the process of writing this that it was no longer maintained), an <code>ls</code> replacement. Generating output that at least to me, is a little easier on the eyes (and has support for icons for those that care about that sort of thing)</p>
<p>I use the following aliases in my .zshrc file:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash"># Substitute ls with eza
alias ls=&quot;eza --icons&quot;
alias ll=&quot;eza --icons --header -l&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>duf</h2>
<p>Do you enjoy checking the remaining space of your drives with <code>df</code> but hate the way it's formatted? <code>duf</code> will print out the information in a very human readable and aesthetic way. <a href="https://github.com/muesli/duf">Installation and usage instructions for duf can be found here</a></p>

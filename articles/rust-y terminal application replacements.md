Supposedly well informed people have informed me that Rust is the future of low level programming. Although, to be fair; compared to JavaScript pretty much everything else is low level programming at this point, so what would I know about it? (the joke being that JavaScript uses a lot of memory)

Memory safety with the borrow checker! An actual package manager! developer experience! the dream is real! By sheer, utter coincidence the next couple of terminal applications I list here are written in Rust.

## bat

[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is nice drop-in replacement for `cat` that features neat features like syntax highlighting for multiple programming and markup languages, line numbers and displaying multiple files output at once.

## eza

[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) is a fork of exa (which I found out during the process of writing this that it was no longer maintained), an `ls` replacement. Generating output that at least to me, is a little easier on the eyes (and has support for icons for those that care about that sort of thing)

I use the following aliases in my .zshrc file:

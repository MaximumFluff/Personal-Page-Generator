date_created: 29/09/2025

Recently at Kesko our development team took part in accessibility training to make sure our services were compliant with the relevant laws. This course was mentioned by the trainers, thus I decided to give it a crack. a11y was a subject that I wasn't the strongest on before the training, and I wanted to take every opportunity I could to strengthen them.

## Course Structure

The course is comprised of 5 modules:

* Module 1: What is Web Accessibility
    * Mostly about understanding how people with disabilites use the web
* Module 2: People and digital technology
    * Goes into detail about different kinds of a11y hardware/software
* Module 3: Business cases and benefits
    * Discusses how a11y can benefit your organization and users
* Module 4: Principles, standards, and checks
    * Discusses various a11y standards (e.g. WCAG)
* Module 5: Getting started with accessibility in your organization
    * Details how you can manage and implement a11y company wide

## Training material

The video content I found especially valuable. Real users with disabilites demonstrated how they use various tools to access the web and the struggles they find everyday while doing so. I can confidently say I learnt a few things I didn't know before, even after taking the work training. it inspired me to make sure I make my site as accessible as possible and what to consider doing so. For example:

* I'm not sure my colour scheme is condusive to people with colour blind issues so I will be investigating that
* Links with titles like "Read more" or "click here" are not really useful for people using screen readers so I made sure to change those to more descriptive text
* I shouldn't be using images that aren't strictly neccessary. An example, I used to have an image that just contained text. I then corrected one instance of that in a previous article.

Some of the issues they go into detail about might strike some as obvious, but I learnt some things that surprised me. For example, some people with autism or cognitive issues rely on screen readers, not just the blind. it can be really easy not to consider the issues the disabled might face so this course was a success making one empathize with them and the struggles they face.

Like most online courses, the course is structured around videos with supplementary reading material. Every section of a module ends with graded questions (either true/false or multiple choice questions)

While most questions will have answers that are quite obvious (assuming, you were paying attention to the material even slightly) but there are some questions that are thrown in there that will require you to think and maybe re-read material to double check your knowledge, which I appreciate. Despite being a beginners course for a11y, you can't just sleepwalk through it.

Assuming you paid for it, you require 70% or higher to be awarded the certificate.

## Is the certificate worth it?

I imagine this will be the main concern of those reading this article. the cost is 99$ (at the time of writing, 87â‚¬) which for a beginner course, is not nothing. As a brave pioneer in exploring training courses for my organization, I bit the bullet and bought it (I will hold for applause now) but I understand that others might be wary. I suppose the main value proposition would be: Do you consider having a verified certificate on your LinkedIn that you can show off worth it?

If not, you are able to "audit" the course for free. You won't receive a certificate, but you can peruse the materials at your own pace. One issue I must point out is that there is a time limit on the course. You can review the materials for a couple of months before your access expires. If you paid for the certificate you will still be on a time limit but you can access the materials even after the course ends (but will not be able to claim the certificate if you didn't finish the course in time)

## Final thoughts

Even if you are iffy on the price, I would recommend at least auditing the material if you feel like a11y and its benefits is a subject that you need to brush up on. More people than you think can benefit from the implementation of a11y into your company and related products. Also, it is an objectively moral thing to do, even if you aren't compelled to do so by your local laws!
